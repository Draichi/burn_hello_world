# Burn MNIST Example

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a custom model built with Burn. We will train a simple convolutional neural network model on the MNIST dataset and prepare it for inference.

Our goal will be to create a basic convolutional neural network used for image classification. We will keep the model simple by using two convolution layers followed by two linear layers, some pooling and ReLU activations. We will also use dropout to improve training performance.
